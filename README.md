## Example Generated Prompts

Here are a few examples of the prompts this system can generate:

1. "A Moroccan teen adjusts her neural interface beneath an ancient archway, fingertips tracing weathered stone as quantum calculations filter through her consciousness. The marketplace around her buzzes with AI-mediated commerce, while heritage-preservation nanobots silently repair centuries-old mosaics. The bitter scent of traditional tea mingles with the ozone tang of charging stations."

2. "Deep beneath Pacific waters, aquaculture engineers with gill-like respiratory implants harvest pharmaceutical compounds from gene-tailored kelp forests. Their transparent underwater habitation sphere filters sunlight into prismatic patterns across coral-inspired architecture. Climate stabilization buoys transmit data overhead, their rhythmic pulses creating a percussive underwater soundscape."

3. "An elderly botanist with arthritic hands manipulates quantum soil particles through gestural commands, his weathered skin contrasting with the pristine white lab. Artificial pollinators buzz between experimental drought-resistant crops while atmospheric moisture harvesters hum softly overhead. The sweet-earthy scent of accelerated growth cycles permeates the Afrofuturist-designed agricultural dome."

1. Open `future_vision_generator.py`
2. Change the following parameters:
   - Set a different output path by modifying the `output_path` variable in the `main()` function
   - Adjust the number of prompts to generate by changing the `count` parameter in the `generate_and_save()` function call
   - Modify the categories list to focus on specific themes
   - Fine-tune the agent instructions for different creative directions

## Example Output

The generator produces richly detailed prompts like these:

1. "Neural interface specialists monitor quantum language translation systems in a multi-cultural orbital community, while artificial cherry blossom petals drift through the air recycling corridors. The Relegoai insignia pulses subtly on memory archive terminals."

2. "A joint team of human mycologists and fungal-network AI works to restore biodiversity in former wasteland zones. Their bare hands sink into rejuvenated soil as sensory feedback data flows through organic neural pathways, creating healing feedback loops."

3. "Inside a Himalayan vertical agricultural tower, elderly knowledge keepers with climate-responsive neural implants teach botanical programming to young students. The air carries a subtle scent of genetically-optimized herbs as ancient practices merge with genome cultivation techniques."

4. "An Ethiopian quantum physicist fine-tunes carbon-negative atmospheric harvesters above a revitalized lake basin. The humming machines extract pollutants that become raw materials for the region's molecular fabrication network, their circuitry displaying 'Relegoai' diagnostics."

5. "Martian settlement architects with partial synthetic biology adaptations engage in heated debate with AI infrastructure collectives about expanding underground habitation tunnels. Fingertips generate tactile holographic projections while dust particles shimmer in the filtered light."
