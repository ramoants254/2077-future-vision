# Project Overview for GitHub & LinkedIn

## Project Title
2077: AI-Powered Futuristic Vision Prompt Generator

## Short Description (LinkedIn)
I've created an AI-powered prompt generator that envisions the world of 2077, where humans, technology, and AI coexist in fascinating ways. Built with Python and OpenAI's GPT-4.1 mini through the Agents SDK, it creates detailed, diverse scenarios perfect for digital art, concept design, worldbuilding, and creative writing. Check it out on my GitHub!

## Long Description (GitHub)
This project uses cutting-edge AI to generate highly detailed prompts depicting our world in 2077. By analyzing current technological trajectories and extrapolating their evolution, it creates realistic yet imaginative scenarios across multiple domains including neural interfaces, space exploration, urban development, and more.

## Key Features to Highlight
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4.1 mini model through the Agents SDK
- Generates high-quality, diverse prompts for creative projects
- Explores 24+ futuristic domains from consciousness transfer to climate engineering
- Balances utopian and dystopian elements with cultural diversity
- Creates varied aesthetic styles beyond common sci-fi clichés
- Ensures non-repetitive, unique outputs through careful prompt engineering

## Sharing Strategy

### For GitHub:
- Share the full code repository with comprehensive documentation
- Include sample outputs in the README to demonstrate quality
- Showcase 10-15 example prompts that represent diverse themes
- Keep your agent prompt instructions public - this demonstrates your expertise in prompt engineering
- Consider adding a license that allows personal use but requires attribution

### For LinkedIn:
- Share 3-5 of your best generated prompts as examples
- Post an image created from one of your prompts (if possible)
- Explain how the project demonstrates your skills in AI integration, creative development, and Python programming
- Link to your GitHub repository for those interested in exploring more

## Why Share Your Full Prompt Instructions?
Sharing your 20-point prompt instruction system actually showcases your expertise in prompt engineering - an increasingly valuable skill. It demonstrates your understanding of how to create balanced, diverse outputs while avoiding common AI generation pitfalls like repetitiveness and clichés. The real value of your work is in the overall system design, code implementation, and creative direction.
